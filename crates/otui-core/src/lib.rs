//! The pure OTUI/OTML language engine.
//!
//! `otui-core` holds all language semantics — parsing, diagnostics, symbols, completion and
//! formatting — with **no I/O and no dependency on `lsp-types`**. Everything it returns is
//! expressed in byte offsets via the [`lang-api`] contract, so the same engine can back the LSP
//! server or be embedded directly in an editor.
//!
//! Behavior is a faithful mirror of the real OTClient engine (opentibiabr), per the spec vendored at
//! `docs/otui-language-service-spec.md`. The [`syntax`] tree-sitter substrate underpins every
//! feature module: [`diagnostics`], [`completion`], [`hover`], [`property_hover`], [`symbols`],
//! [`navigation`], [`references`], [`hierarchy`], [`format`], [`indent`], [`folding`], [`semantic`],
//! [`colors`], [`links`], [`fixes`], plus the workspace-index building blocks ([`style_index`],
//! [`lua_widgets`], [`lua_refs`], [`widget_resolve`]) and the engine data ([`schema`], [`catalog`]).
//! The [`LanguageService`] trait
//! and the inherent [`OtuiService`] methods below are the entry points the server drives.
